## Notices:
- In this section, we will recap all the information obtained during the presentation of the BSC to **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._**.
- To accomplish this task, we will review the overall objectives of a **_BSC_**.

Managing an organization requires executives to have a broad vision that involves various indicators simultaneously in different areas.

An advantage of the BSC is that it avoids information overload by limiting the number of indicators used, focusing on those that are relevant to achieving the set strategic objectives.

In our BSC, we have limited the KPIs to **_LTV_** (activable and possible with the available data). Furthermore, **_LTV_** provides us with key information for the business of **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._**. It tells us whether we are spending too much or too little on acquiring customers. Additionally, it evaluates the value a customer brings to a company throughout their entire business relationship. **_LTV_** is important because it allows us to assess how profitable a customer is during their relationship with us, which is crucial when compared to what it has cost us to acquire them (acquisition cost).

Remember that currently, **_Adventure Works Cycles, Inc._** sells:
